A seven-year-old child, indeed, a silly fool, can figure it out on his fingers - although you, stupid ass, cannot understand anything.
All Christians should be on guard against your antichristian poison.
All you say is sealed with the devil's own dirt.
Are you ignorant of what it means to be ignorant?
Are you not making an elephant out of a fly? What wonder workers!
Before God and men I accuse all of you as arsonists, blasphemers, murderers, and ravagers of Christian piety.
Blind moles!
Dear God, what an utterly shameless, blasphemous lying-mouth you are!
Do you not see here the devil, the enemy of God's order?
Doctor Sow.
Even if the Antichrist appears, what greater evil can he do than what you have done and do daily?
Even Lucifer was not guilty of so great a sacrilege in heaven, for he only presumed to be God's equal. God help us!
Everyone can see that such a sentence must have been blown into you by all the existing devils with one breath.
Finally you cannot help yourself but spew out good, fat, strong lies, and like a mad person speak against yourself.
For you are an excellent person, as skilful, clever, and versed in Holy Scripture as a cow in a walnut tree or a sow on a harp.
Get out in the name of a thousand devils, and break your neck before you are out of the city.
Go, you whore, go to the devil for all I care.
Heaven and earth are in danger of caving in because of your heresies.
Here now, you ass, with your long donkey ears and accursed liar's mouth!
How far will you go, O devilish pride?
How is it, then, that you drivel like people in their second childhood?
I am tired of the pestilent voice of your sirens.
I beg you put your glasses on your nose, or blow your nose a bit, to make your head lighter and the brain clearer.
I can with good conscience consider you a fart-ass and an enemy of God.
I must stop: I can no longer rummage in your blasphemous, hellish devil's filth and stench.
I think that all the devils have at once entered into you.
I think that if you were alone in the field, an angry cat would be enough to scare you away.
I think you received these ideas in your pipe dreams.
I would not smell the foul odor of your name.
In devil's fashion you go out where God would enter and enter where God goes out. It ought surprise no one that I call you a devil.
In lying fashion you ignore what even children know.
It is presumptuous for people who are as ignorant as you are not to take up the work of a herdsman.
It is the old dragon from the abyss of hell who is standing before me!
Let this generation of vipers prepare itself for unquenchable fire!
Listen, murdered of souls and sinful spirit!
Listen, you ass, you are a particularly crass ass, indeed, you are a filthy sow!
Look how this great heretic speaks brazenly and sacrilegiously.
May the devil stay with you in this blasphemous, murderous, sinful, pernicious thing.
May the Lord Jesus protect me and all devout souls from your contagion and your company!
Must we believe your nightmares?
My soul, like Ezekiel's, is nauseated at eating your bread covered with human dung. Do you know what this means?
O you wolf in Christendom!
People of your sort are hirelings, dumb dogs unable to bark, who see the wolf coming and flee or, rather, join up with the wolf.
Perhaps you like to hear yourself talk, as the stork its own clattering.
Perhaps you want me to die of unrelieved boredom while you keep on talking.
Phooey on you, you servant of idols!
Proteus is no Proteus compared with you.
Snot-nose!
Stupid spirit.
Take care, you evil and wrathful spirits. God may ordain that in swallowing you may choke to death.
The devil rides you.
The hellish Satan drives you.
The very devil himself would thank you for such an event, and no one but the miserable devil and his devilish scum would go there.
There you are in the chains of divine judgment, bound in hell like all the devils.
There you are, like butter in sunshine.
This is pure knavery with which the devil here deals. Tell me, you who are so pure, why are you here so filthy?
This new thing you have devised is the vilest cesspool that the devil has on earth.
This venom - the mere smell of which kills a man!
Truly, I never imagined, and at the same time was shocked, to see how deeply you still cling to your errors.
We despise your whorish impudence.
We leave you to your own devices, for nothing properly suits you except hypocrisy, flattery, and lies.
We may confidently suppose and be sure that your spirit will produce evidence and proof when the devil becomes God.
We see you, you black, ugly devil!
Were you against the heathen Priapus, he would probably pass wind in the face of such well-aimed terror.
What a fine spirit we have here, who would drive out the devil by a devil. Indeed you would disgrace public truth with public lies.
What bilgewater of heresies has ever been spoken so heretically as what you have said?
What devilish unchristian thing would you not undertake?
What do you mean when you say this? Are you dreaming in the throes of a fever or are you laboring under a madness?
What else can one say here, except that these ideas originate in your own wanton concoctions, or in a drunken dream?
What good purpose can you lazy, sluggish bullies accomplish?
What happened to the house built on sand in Matthew 7 will also happen to you.
What light can there be in heads that hold such tangible darkness?
What pig sties could compare in goings-on with you?
What you say is a blasphemy that has made you worthy of a thousand deaths.
Why would anyone tolerate such things from someone like you, a rotten paunch, crude ass and fart-ass?
With all your cleverness you are nothing but devil's fools.
Yes, what happened to you is what must happen when one paints the devil above the door and asks him to be godfather.
You - like the spider which sucks only poison from the rose - draw only vain pride from the doctrine of humility.
You abominable abomination.
You arch-assassin and bloodhound, the like of which has never been seen under the sun.
You are a Baal-zebub - that is, a man of flies.
You are a brothel-keeper and the devil's daughter in hell.
You are a bungling magpie, croaking loudly.
You are a coarse devil who hurts me but little.
You are a crude ass, and an ass you will remain!
You are a little pious prancer.
You are a person of sin and the child of perdition, leading all the world with you to the devil, using your lying and deceitful ways.
You are a toad eater and a fawner.
You are a wolf and apostle of Satan.
You are admirable, fine, pious sows and asses.
You are an abominable arch-heretic.
You are an extraordinary creature, being neither God nor man. Perhaps you are the devil himself.
You are blasphemous, abominable rascals and damned scum of Satan.
You are dumber than Seriphian frogs and fishes.
You are emissaries of the devil.
You are full of poisonous refuse and insane foolishness.
You are idiots and swine.
You are ignorant, stupid, godless blasphemers.
You are in all you do the very opposite of Christ as befits a true Antichrist.
You are indeed cheated and deceived by falsehood, and that is what all like you deserve.
You are inimical asses!
You are jugglers of imaginary sins.
You are like a magician who conjures gulden into the mouths of silly people, but when they open their mouths they have horse dirt in them.
You are like mouse-dropping in the pepper.
You are like swine who indiscriminately devour everything.
You are not a pious fraud, but an infernal, diabolical, antichristian fraud.
You are not human beings, but empty shells and shadows.
You are pious and honest people, who cannot do anything but calumniate and lie.
You are poisonous, worthless gossips.
You are spiritual scarecrows and monk calves.
You are such outrageous, shameless blockheads.
You are the cousins of the Antichrist.
You are the devil's donkey.
You are the devil's most dangerous tool!
You are the founder and master of all sins.
You are the most insane heretics and ingrafters of heretical perversity.
You are the prostitute of heretics!
You are the Roman Nimrod and a teacher of sin.
You are the scum of all the scoundrels.
You are the sin-master and soul-murdered.
You are the true print and touch of the devil.
You are the true, chief, and final Antichrist.
You are the ultimate scourges of the world, the Antichrist together with your sophists and bishops.
You are the white devil and a glittering Satan.
You are the worst rascal of all the rascals on earth!
You are worthy only to be mocked by the words of error.
You arsonists, enemies of languages and truth!
You ass, abecedarian, and bacchanal.
You blubber and writhe along with all the devils in hell.
You completely close your mind and do nothing but shout, "Anathema, anathema, anathema!" so that by your own voice you are judged mad.
You condemned the holy gospel and replaced it with the teaching of the dragon from hell.
You conduct yourself like one drunk or asleep, belching out between your snores, "Yes, No."
You cowardly slave, you corrupt sycophant, with your sickening advice!
You dear asses.
You do nothing with all your profusion of words but fight a fire with dry straw.
You forgot to purge yourself with hellabore while you were preparing to fabricate this lie.
You foster in your heart a Lucian, or some other pig from Epicurus' sty.
You gamble with God's Word like a rogue.
You have a perverted spirit that thinks only of murdering the conscience.
You have a priesthood of Satan.
You have fought against us as one would attack a cliff with a broken straw.
You have lost head, eyes, brain, and heart, since you know neither shame nor fear, and dare wager all according to your whims.
You have set out to rub your scabby, scurvy head against honor.
You have surrendered yourself and dared to become an avowed enemy of God, wanting to race rather than trot to hell.
You have the master-devil all right.
You hellish scum.
You hold fast to human dreams and the doctrines of devils.
You know less than does a log on the ground.
You like as an arch rascal and disgraceful scoundrel.
You live like Epicureans and sows. So the fat is in the fire!
You loathsome, accursed, atrocious monster.
You ought to feel shame in your hearts, you great gruff asses' heads.
You pant after the garlic and melons of Egypt and have already long suffered from perverted tastes.
You people are more stupid than a block of wood.
You plunge in like a sow to devour pearls, and like a dog tearing holy things to pieces.
You poisonous loudmouth.
You poor devil.
You pusillanimous scoundrel.
You reek of nothing but Lucian, and you breathe out on me the vast drunken folly of Epicurus.
You roar as one possessed and full of devils.
You run against God with the horns of your pride up in the air and thus plunge into the abyss of hell. Woe unto you, Antichrist!
You rush forward as an ass under the pelt of a lion.
You seem to be wrangling about goat's wool, like the man who watched the play in an empty theater.
You seem to me to be a real masterpiece of the devil's art.
You sharp-eyed bats.
You should rightly be called lawyers for asses.
You sophistic worms, grasshoppers, locusts, frogs and lice!
You speak and act only as an ungodly person does.
You stink like devilish filth flung into Germany.
You teach the disorderly masses to break into this field in disorder like pigs.
You vulgar boor, blockhead, and lout, you ass to cap all asses, screaming your heehaws.
You wear a pair of cobweb trousers, like a man who, being naked, put on a new to hide his shame.
You worship a Dagon and a god of your stomachs.
You're a gross, ungrateful clod, worthy of being numbered among the beasts.
You, devil and Hanswurst, are in this matter a particularly silly <i>wurst</i> to lie so shamefully.

Your Hellishness.
Your sin smells to high heaven.
Your words are so foolishly and ignorantly composed that I cannot believe you understand them.
Your words are un-Christian, antichristian, and spoken by the inspiration of the evil spirit.
